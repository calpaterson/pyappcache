# Changelog

## 0.10.0
### Added

- A new FilesystemCache
- Added a new serialiser which uses Parquet instead of pickle for Pandas
  dataframes: `pyappcache.serialisation.pandas.DataFrameAwareSerialiser`.
- Support for Python 3.12
- A new `BinaryFileSerialiser`

### Changed

- Caches now work on buffers internally, rather than strs
  - This is a breaking change for compressors and serialisers
  - This seems to work much better for larger values (eg dataframes, csv files,
    etc)
- SqliteCache will now use [incremental blob
  I/O](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/blob.html) where possible (eg Python 3.11+)
- Fixed an issue with the default prefix being "pyappache"
- Sort out CacheControlProxy
